# Geek Room — Development Department (2025-26)

This repository contains documentation for the Development Department of Geek Room for the academic year 2025-26. The Development Department coordinates coding tasks, projects, and learning activities. Tasks will be provided by the department leads and assigned to members as described below.

## Overview

- Department: Development
- Year: 2025-26
- Purpose: Provide a structured environment for students and contributors to learn software development, collaborate on projects, complete assignments, and contribute to departmental codebases.

## Objectives

1. Teach practical web development skills through hands-on tasks and projects.
2. Deliver small, well-scoped project tasks regularly to build portfolio work.
3. Maintain a clear task assignment and review process so contributors can learn and improve.

## Team & Roles

- Department Lead(s): Responsible for planning curriculum, task creation, and final approvals.
- Mentors / TAs: Help review work, guide contributors, and provide feedback.
- Contributors / Students: Pick up tasks, follow guidelines, and submit work for review.

## How Tasks Will Be Provided

- Tasks will be created by department leads and posted in the designated task channel (e.g., class platform or repository issues). Each task will include a title, description, acceptance criteria, and a suggested estimate.
- Tasks may be distributed as repository issues, assignment sheets, or shared documents. Refer to the assignment posting for how to claim a task.

## Task Assignment & Workflow

1. Task posted by lead/mentor with details and acceptance criteria.
2. Contributor claims the task (comment on issue / assign to self) following the platform rules.
3. Work is implemented in a dedicated branch (see Branching below).
4. Open a Pull Request (PR) with a clear description, steps to test, and link to the task/issue.
5. A mentor or lead reviews the PR; feedback is addressed by the contributor.
6. After approval, the PR is merged and the task is marked complete.

## Branching & Naming Conventions

- Use feature branches for work: `feature/<short-description>` (e.g., `feature/login-form`).
- Use `fix/` for bug fixes and `chore/` for maintenance tasks.
- Keep branch names short, lowercase, and hyphen-separated.

## Commit & PR Guidelines

- Commit messages should be concise and descriptive. Use present tense and reference task IDs when applicable.
- PR titles should reference the task (issue) number and a short summary.
- Include testing steps in the PR description and any screenshots or demo links if relevant.

## Development Tools & Stack (Suggested)

- Languages: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (and frameworks taught during the year).
- Recommended tools: Node.js, npm/yarn, Git, a modern IDE (VS Code recommended).
- Use standard linters and formatters (ESLint, Prettier) when applicable.

## Code Review & Quality

- Reviews focus on functionality, clarity, accessibility, and code style.
- Keep changes small and focused to make reviews faster and more educational.
- Document any non-obvious decisions in PR descriptions.

## Communication & Meetings

- Primary communication channels (choose as per department setup): Slack/Discord / Microsoft Teams / class LMS.
- Weekly standups or progress check-ins as scheduled by leads.

## Contribution Guidelines

- Follow the assignment's acceptance criteria strictly.
- Ask questions early — mentors are there to help.
- Respect deadlines and communicate if you cannot meet them.

## Deliverables & Evaluation

- Each task will list required deliverables (code, documentation, demo link).
- Mentors will provide feedback and grade or mark completion per the course rubric.

## File Structure (repository-specific)

- Keep each task or project in its own folder when requested.
- Use clear README files inside subfolders to explain run steps or demo instructions.

## Code of Conduct

- Be respectful and constructive in reviews and communication.
- Plagiarism: Always cite sources and avoid copying others' work as your own.

## Contacts

- For task questions and mentorship: contact the department lead or assigned mentor per the class roster.
