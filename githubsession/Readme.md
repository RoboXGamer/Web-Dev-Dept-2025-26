# GitHub Session â€” Attendance Instructions

Attendance for the Development Department (Geek Room, 2025-26) must be recorded by creating a plain text file in this folder named exactly after you (no spaces) with a `.txt` extension.

Rules:

- File name format: `<yourname>.txt` (use lowercase, omit spaces). Example: `yashvardhanrawat.txt` corresponds to attendance for "Yashvardhan Rawat".
- Create the file inside this `githubsession` folder on the day you are marking attendance.
- The file can be empty or contain a single line with the date/time or a short note (optional).
- If you need to update or correct attendance, update or replace your file and add a short comment inside explaining the change.

Example

1. To mark attendance for Yashvardhan Rawat, create `yashvardhanrawat.txt` in this folder.
2. Optionally add the date inside the file, e.g. `2025-10-26`.

Notes

- Keep the filename consistent with your roster name so mentors can track attendance automatically or manually.
- If you have a special character in your name, use a simplified ASCII version (e.g., remove accents) and inform the mentor.

If you'd like, I can add a small script to validate that attendance files are present for a given date or generate a simple attendance log from the files.
